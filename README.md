## CaseStudy: How-Does-a-Bike-Share-Navigate-Speedy-Success

This is a case study about a fictional company Cyclistic.

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that
are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system.

In this case study, five million data records in the past twelve months have been analyzed to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, recommenndations are given to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
